<p> Artist : Olivier Lloris </p>
<p> Medium :Clay,Steel(wires) </p>
<p> Title :New world </p>
<p> Year :2019 </p>
<p> ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:From the beloved city of Paris Olivier wanted to show us the depths of its dark side that most people do not see from a far.
The sculptures represent the citizens of France that endures through the crime. The few sculptures with no face represent those who do not endure the crime
but still ignore it when seeing it happen to others. These sculptures amazingly capture the expressions Olivier wanted to convey.</p>
